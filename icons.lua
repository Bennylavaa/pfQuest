-- Custom Icons for Specific Nodes

-- This file contains custom icon definitions for specific nodes in the game.
-- Each node has a unique identifier that is used to determine its localized name.

-- used to assign icons to units. To avoid duplicates, it's essential to use only
-- one id per object or unit name.
